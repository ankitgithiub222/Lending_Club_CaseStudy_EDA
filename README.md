# Lending_Club_CaseStudy_EDA
> In this case study, We will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. Means if the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the credit company.

## General Information
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access       lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
#### Background:
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money   lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the       lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such             applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
#### Problem Statement
- With EDA we will understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  Which can   be     utilized for risk assessment.
